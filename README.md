# Firefox browser extension

School project

We created a firefox browser extension "Limit the datas (for earth)" that block all the pictures to load. 
What's for ? To limit the amount of datas and to reduce the ecological impact.

To try it :
First clone the repo.
Type "about:debugging" in the Firefox URL bar and click on "this firefox".
Add a temporary extension.
