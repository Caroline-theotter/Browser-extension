# Firefox browser extension

School project

We created a firefox browser extension "Limit the datas (for earth)" that block all the pictures to load. 
What's for ? To limit the amount of datas and to reduce the ecological impact.

First clone the repo and add the extension on the following <a href="about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox">link</a> as a temporary extension.
